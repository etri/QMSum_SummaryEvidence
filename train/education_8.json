                    "The meeting between the Children, Young People and Education Committee and the Welsh Government was considered as a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015.",
                    "To start with, Kirsty Williams AM suggested although the Bill was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, it was still valuable to discuss in the current context.",
                    "The Act had partly fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy.",
                    "Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate, co-ordinating and fund the sector.",
                    "When it comes to the future of the Act, the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission, and students' interests must be fully preserved.",
                    "Meanwhile, some participants argued that HEFCW's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate.",
                    "Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained.",
                    "Besides, the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act, in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support.",
                    "In the end, Kirsty Williams AM praised the contribution from overseas providers in supporting transnational education in Wales and agreed that rights of students in Wales should always be put in the first place."
