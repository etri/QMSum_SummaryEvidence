                    "Dr Frank Atherton, at the same time, indicated that there was a n exact evaluation and the nation has already imposed tax on sugar and the first Minister will definitely be the ultimate man at the wheel.",
                    "Then they paid much attention to existing data measuring child obesity and decided to put it in great use in tackling obesity.",
                    "Meanwhile, the meeting talked about government legislation for some sort of things like restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and sports infrastructure in schools as part of efforts to make a healthy environment.",

                    "Also, they had a discussion on physical education and school meals for pupils.",
                    "Finally, the meeting participants gave some supplements of education and the draft strategy and the chair concluded the meeting with the future universality of the draft strategy."
